# Week 06

I found a poem titled 'Love Explained' by Jennifer Michael Hecht on the Poetry Foundation website (https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/49250/love-explained). My assignment is divided into three main components:

Scrolling Verse: The poem itself, which will be presented on the right of the website.

Title Mouse: A feature related to the poem's title.

Transparent Theme Highlight: An element located on the far left side of the webpage.

Additionally, I've incorporated a circular logo to emphasize the theme of love in the background of the love letter.

One of the challenges I encountered during the implementation was ensuring that the text appears both on the left and right sides of the page.
